## OOP Assignment 2 - Making a Game through the Unity platform

### Team Name - KOD

### Description:
Our game is a FPS (First Person Shooter) game made through the Unity Platform using C#.  Our game is based on the idea of an area filled with targets. Each target appears in a random area and each level spawns more targets with an increased rate of speed. The user has a time limit to shoot as much targets as possible with each target providing a score. 

### Team Members: 
#### Jack Byrne - spawn targets at random position in scenes. Moving at random speeds. Helped with scoring.
#### Mikey Keddy - Display options to the user and add sound effects. Added code for the different scenes.
#### Eoin Lambert - Added Raycast code and added functions for the gun (weapon switching). Destroy Targets when hit.
#### Josh Lambert - Added scores and timer for the player. Helped with spawn targets. Initial setup for scenes.
